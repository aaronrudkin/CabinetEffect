Past research offers competing theories about the electoral value of cabinet membership. Some authors identify the electoral benefit of developing a "personal vote", while others demonstrate a party-level ``cost of governing'' stemming from broken or under-realized policy promises, attribution of blame to governing parties, and the accumulation of grievances. Adjudicating this question is complicated by sample selection biases with respect to incumbents who choose to run for re-election and endogeneity with respect to those offered cabinet positions. I examine Canadian data post-1945 and find a modest but substantively relevant benefit of 1-3% vote share across model specifications. Subsequently, I conduct a mediation analysis and identify increased media coverage as a plausible explanation of the electoral return to cabinet. Understanding cabinet membership as producing an electoral return adds to our understanding of individual incentives to join cabinet and party-level strategic considerations when forming cabinet.
